### 4. 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (ML Project)

* A **Machine Learning model** to predict Titanic passenger survival.
* **Steps performed:**

  * Data cleaning & preprocessing
  * Feature engineering (Title, FamilySize, IsAlone, etc.)
  * Random Forest Classifier training & evaluation
  * Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report generated
* **Outputs:**

  * `titanic_cleaned.csv` (processed dataset)
  * `titanic_predictions.csv` (dataset with survival predictions)

📂 File: `Titanic_model.py`

### 5. 🌸 Iris Flower Classification (ML Project)

* A **Machine Learning model** to classify Iris flowers into **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**.
* **Steps performed:**

  * Data loading & preprocessing
  * Train-test split
  * Random Forest Classifier training
  * Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report generated
  * Visualizations: pairplots, confusion matrix heatmap, feature importance
* **Outputs:**

  * `iris_cleaned.csv` (processed dataset)
  * `iris_predictions.csv` (dataset with predictions)

📂 File: `IRIS_model.py`

Would you like me to also **add screenshots** for Titanic & Iris visualizations (like survival plots and iris pairplots) in the README just like I did with Portfolio preview?
